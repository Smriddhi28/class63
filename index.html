            Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, OM, KBE, FRS, FREng, FRSA, DFBCS, RDI (born 8 June 1955), also known as
            TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML
            markup language, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of
            Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

            Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first
            successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet
            in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and
            helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of the World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with
            Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the
            National Academy of Sciences.
